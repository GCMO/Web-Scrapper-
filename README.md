# Web-Scrapper
Web Scrapping Experimentation. 

The following two files are my first attempts at scrapping finanacial data from the net. 
Lessons Learned: there are many exchanges offering financial historical data and real time data for free and on a premium. 
It is unnecessary and combersom to collect the data using a scapping program, specially because the data most often needs
to be cleaned manually. I explored the option of automating the data cleaning process but discovered free clean data and 
NLP for summarization. 
Overall this scrapping exercise will probably come handy for other purposes. Probably "**Sentiment Analysis**"
